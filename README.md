**INTRODUCTION**

Hello and welcome to my portfolio, I am excited to have you here.

In this repository, you'll com across som eof th eproject I've worked as a data analyst.
In those projects, you'll be able to see my skills using database management systems (DBMS) and 
integrated development environments (IDEs). 
As you'll learn by my projects, during my journey to became a data analyst, I gained skills in SQL, R and Tableau. 
I can clean, organize and analyze data to make informed and data-driven decisions, providing valuable insights for strategic 
planning and effective problem-solving.

In this section, I will introduce myself. Let's start by saying that, even though I am new to the data analysis world, I find it fascinating. 
I am amazed at how data can tell you so much about any subject you wish to learn, and deepening my knowledge
in this field is something I am eager to pursue. 

  **About my journey**

I have a background in childhood development and special needs; therefore, I've honed my social skills and learned how to 
analyze situations, consider different scenarios, and act quickly. I have also acquired the ability to stay calm and positive 
so that I, along with the team, could achieve the goals we had set, even though the path we were 
on wasn't as smooth.
My Jornuey as a data analyst began a year ago, when I decided I wanted to challenge my self and learn new skills. Right about 
that time, Coursera came out with the "data analyst certificate", which I had successfully complited. From there, i discovered the world of QUERY and coding.
To be honest, it was quite challenging to master SQL, but now, I enjoy looking at database, writing query to learn more about my data,
putting clues together and end with a stunning viz that will show my founding and my prospectives.
